**********Adjacency lists vs matrices**********

lists                              ||                     matrices
# suitable for sparse                    # suitable for dense graphs
 graphs (more zeroes and less 1)                

# takes less space                       # takes more space

# difficult handle for begginners

eg: social network graphs 
 like facebook and insta
