# Algorithms
Hello folks ! I wanted to have an absolute begginer to intermediate guide to algorithms to have better clarity and understanding!
More importantly we will look at concepts and real world examples more than the code as it can be easily googled!! 

### Through each topic we will analyze the asymptotic time complexity and how we could futher reduce time and space through better code , approach or algos

## Contents 

* Matrix Multiplication -ALGOS
   * matrix chain multiplication 
   * strasen multiplication 
   * normal vs strassen vs vectorized

      basic implementation of | bfs | dfs| Topological sort | Kahn's Algorithm| Minimum spanning tree |Prim's Algo
      Krushkal's Algo| Shortest paths 

     

* Heuristic of solving algorithms
