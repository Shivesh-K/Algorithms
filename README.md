# Algorithms
Hello folks ! I wanted to have an absolute begginer to intermediate guide to algorithms to have better clarity and understanding!
More importantly we will look at concepts and real world examples more than the code as it can be easily googled!! 

### Through each topic we will analyze the asymptotic time complexity and how we could futher reduce time and space through better code , approach or algos

## Contents 

* Matrix Multiplication -ALGOS
   * matrix chain multiplication 
   * strasen multiplication 
   * normal vs strassen vs vectorized
   
   
* Heuristic approach of solving algorithms

* Finding simiarity between various documents 

* Continued...
 



All contributions are highly encouraged !

Thank you !
