# Algorithms
Hello folks ! I wanted to have an absolute begginer to intermediate guide to algorithms to have better clarity and understanding!
More importantly we will look at concepts and real world examples more than the code as it can be easily googled!! 

### Through each topic we will analyze the asymptotic time complexity and how we could futher reduce time and space through better code , approach or algos

## Contents 

* Matrix Multiplication -ALGOS
   * matrix chain multiplication 
   * strasen multiplication 
   * normal vs strassen vs vectorized
   

* Types of GRAPHS

      basic implementation of | bfs | dfs| Topological sort | Kahn's Algorithm| Minimum spanning tree |Prim's Algo
      Krushkal's Algo| Shortest paths| Travelling salesman problem (brute force and greedy)
      

     
* Heuristic of solving algorithms

       A*  and  AO* algorithms , Hill climbing , beam search algorithms

* leetcode problems
   
* Heuristic approach of solving algorithms

* Dynamic Programing

* Understanding Time Complexities !

* Continued...
